To learn through the basic tutorial from github

I'm working since 2015 on the B2B market using mainly SAP (R/3 and CRM) and Excel/VBA for a company that manufacture safety valves. Currently I'm a student of Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) coursing Information Systems currently at the 5/8 semester. I'm have some little projects on python and I'm confortable with the language. Also have familiarity with C and Java (OOP) and nowadays studing Django and SQL (Postgres) through a course on the platform UDEMY.
